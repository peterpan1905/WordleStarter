The game of Wordle (done over as practice by BYU IS Juniors)

Game Instructions:
-Each guess must be a valid five-letter word.

-The color of a tile will change to show you how close your guess was.

-If the tile turns green, the letter is in the word, and it is in the correct spot.

-If the tile turns yellow, the letter is in the word, but it is not in the correct spot.

-If the tile turns gray, the letter is not in the word.
